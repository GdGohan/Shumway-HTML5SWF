# Shumway-HTML5SWF

a program to run flash games (swf) using javascript and html, 
it was a firefox extension to replace the flash player, 
but it has more bugs than ruffle by the way:/ 
FFSX6 runs with audio bug and with a bit of lag in this one player, 
but works in any browser on the phone(unlike ruffle, which only works in slightly more modern browsers).
